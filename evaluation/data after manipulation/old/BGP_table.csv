CVE-2020-1646,CVE-2020-1646,"On Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved devices, processing a specific UPDATE for an EBGP peer can lead to a routing process daemon (RPD) crash and restart. This issue occurs only when the device is receiving and processing the BGP UPDATE for an EBGP peer. This issue does not occur when the device is receiving and processing the BGP UPDATE for an IBGP peer. However, the offending BGP UPDATE can originally come from an EBGP peer, propagates through the network via IBGP peers without causing crash, then it causes RPD crash when it is processed for a BGP UPDATE towards an EBGP peer. Repeated receipt and processing of the same specific BGP UPDATE can result in an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3R3-S6, 17.4R2-S7, and 18.1R3-S7. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 19.2R2-EVO and later versions, prior to 19.3R1-EVO. Other Junos OS releases are not affected.",juniper,"junos, junos_os_evolved",HIGH,CWE-20,BGP,Dependent,Implementation,"The vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of BGP UPDATE messages. The issue arises from how the Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved devices handle specific BGP UPDATE messages. This indicates a flaw in the implementation of the RPD that does not properly process certain updates, leading to a crash.",

CVE-2019-15989,CVE-2019-15989,"A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains a specific BGP attribute. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim&rsquo;s BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.",cisco,"asr_9001, asr_9906, ncs_5516, crs, ncs_5508, ncs_1001, ncs_6000, ncs_5501, ncs_5001, asr_9910, ncs_560, ios_xr, ncs_1002, asr_9901, ncs_5502-se, ncs_1004, ncs_5501-se, ncs_5502, asr_9904, asr_9006, asr_9912, asr_9922, asr_9000v, asr_9010, ncs_540, ncs_540l, xrv_9000, ncs_5002",HIGH,CWE-754,BGP,Related,Implementation,The problem is a related problem because it contains a specific BGP attribute.
